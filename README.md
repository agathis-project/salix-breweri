# AP Guideline

## 1. Abstract

This AP describes the functions of the microcontroller (uC) and their 
implementation - the firmware. The hardware interfaces and main uC 
functionality are described in *AP-1 Root Module HW*.

## 2. Rationale

Without the uC, the root module is dead in the water. At a the bare minimum,
to support the microprocessor (uP) bring-up, the uC needs to turn on the power
converters and take the uP out of reset.

The documenation of the uC firmware is a must; this AP will support just that.
